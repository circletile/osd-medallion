A 3D printable medallion for an World of Tanks OSD meetup in 2017

In partnership with a prior Operation Supply Drop team member, I converted their design into a 3D printable medallion as a gift for other OSD members. One of my first attempts at converting lineart to something editable in Fusion360. Prints came out well on my MPMDv1 printer using a combination of wood PLA and other non-wood PLA colors.
